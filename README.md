# Nature simulatie

### Hierin staat dezelfde info als in netlogo (bij info) zelf, maar hier zet ik het als extra.

## WHAT IS IT?

This model is a self made model that simulates an natural event where baby sea turtles need to walk toward the sea.. during this trip they can be caught by birds

## HOW IT WORKS

The sea turtles will have a single destination where they all walk towards. The birds will move randomly through the simulation until a sea turtle is within a certain range. Than it chases that turtle.

## HOW TO USE IT
This isn't a interactive simulation. I wasn't able to make the amount of turtles and birds interactive with slider due to it being my first project. If you want to change it you need to do it manually in the code.

## THINGS TO NOTICE
1. The birds can sometimes get in an loop and goes back and forward..no idee why.
2. When a bird has more than 1 turtle in its range it will randomly pick one.
3. The speed and chase speed of the sea turtles and birds are random
4. When a bird chases a turtle all turtles will take a step back in attempt to dodge the bird
